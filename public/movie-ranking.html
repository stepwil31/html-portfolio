<h3>Limitless.</h3>
<p>This is a really cool film with Bradley Cooper as the lead.<br /> 
    Imagine being able to take a pill that lets you work consistently at the peak of your potential,<br />

    of demonstrating what the could be like. 8/10.</p>
<h3>PayCheck.</h3>
<p>Another cool film where Ben Affleck plays a reverse engineer who rips off the ideas of competitive tech<br />
    companies for corporations who want dominant market share before getting his memory erased, before taking<br />
    on the job that will earn him enough money to not need to ever work again, but at what cost? 7/10.</p>
